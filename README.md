# Escape-The-Room
A text-based game that is a zork-like clone with point-and-click-adventure puzzle elements.

Developed as a final Windows-console based game project after 3 months of learning C#.

The gameplay is based on writting single word commands like 'pick', 'examine', 'use' or 'move' in addition to a noun representing an object/location in the game.

Premise and controls are explained at the beginning of the game.
For the help menu you can type 'help' or 'h' at any given time, it will show the full list of commands available and som general tips.

You are able to save the state of the game any time and continue back wherever you left.

The game was coded following defensive coding practices.
